Embarking on this project, I delved into the depths of data spanning from January 2020 to March 2023, scrutinizing key facts such as annual sales by category, segment, quarter, year, and region. Our focus extended to discerning the annual total sales percentages across each category and segment.

Initiating the endeavor, I honed my skills in advanced Power BI, equipped with the data provided in CSV format. The dataset revealed its magnitude with over 10,000 rows, accompanied by numerous blank and null values necessitating thorough cleansing.

Here's an overview of my methodology:

Data Cleansing: Recognizing the prevalence of blanks and nulls, I opted for precision over omission. Employing Excel's 'Find and Replace' functionality, I systematically replaced blank cells with zeros. Additionally, employing Excel's 'Remove Duplicates' feature further refined the dataset, ensuring accuracy and eliminating redundancy.

Dataset Integration into Power BI: With the dataset primed, I seamlessly integrated it into Power BI, the cornerstone of my visualization journey. Leveraging its robust features, I strategically selected columns pivotal for analysis, including Order Date, Segment, Region, Category, Sales, Quantity, and Profit.

Visualization: With the data at my fingertips, I embarked on visualizing insights through Power BI's intuitive interface. Utilizing a pie chart, I shed light on the categorical sales distribution, revealing Office Supplies as the frontrunner with 58.5% of total sales, juxtaposed with Technology at 18.93%.

The ensuing visualizations underscored intriguing trends, notably the exponential growth of Office Supplies sales within the Consumer segment across various temporal and regional dimensions. This surge can be attributed to myriad factors, including product quality, market penetration strategies, and regional dynamics, particularly in the West.

In essence, this journey through data analytics illuminated nuanced insights, paving the way for informed decision-making and strategic planning in the realm of sales and marketing."
